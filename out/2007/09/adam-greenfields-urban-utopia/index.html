    What would I do if I had full, SimCityesque control? My urban utopia would assemble these traits, kaleidoscopically:
   </p>
   <p>
    - A setting as gemlike and as accessible to ocean, mountain, forest and desert as San Francisco’s, with winters no worse than that city’s, and summers like Helsinki;
   </p>
   <p>
    - Lots of oxygenating green space;
   </p>
   <p>
    - A zone or zones with the density, skyscraping verticality and walkability of Manhattan, or maybe central Hong Kong, for identity, legibility, and let’s face it, excitement;
   </p>
   <p>
    - Boulevards with the leafy slope and generous broadness of Barcelona’s Ramblas or Tokyo’s Omotesando (at least as the latter existed up until 2003, i.e. prior to the destruction of the Dojunkai Apartments and their replacement with Ando’s jumped-up, pompous mall);
   </p>
   <p>
    - Flabbergasting ethnolinguistic diversity, with all that implies for the eating experience;
   </p>
   <p>
    - Lots of mixed-use close in to the core, and lower-density, more purely residential outlying districts with the easygoingness, human scale and hardy housing stock I remember from my adolescence in West Philadelphia;
   </p>
   <p>
    - These connected to the downtown(s) and to each other by something like the vividly multimodal transitscape of central Amsterdam, where a road, a sidewalk and a bustling bikepath will all converge in crossing over a canal (and I’d thrown in Portland’s light-rail network);
   </p>
   <p>
    - Enough cheap housing so that everyone who wants one has a room to call their own - and enough cheap warehouse/event space to support an arts community like Berlin’s;
   </p>
   <p>
    - The 24-hour bustle and ad-hoc spirit of Seoul - where a vacant lot plus a grill plus a tent equals a nightspot, and in nice weather you don’t even need the tent;
   </p>
   <p>
    - Something in the lay of the streets that recalls Daikanyama, or the winding backways between Shibuya and Ebisu;
   </p>
   <p>
    - It’s undeniably haute-bourgeous, and titled perilously toward consumerism, but if you’re going to have commercial zones I’ve always felt that something works about Berkeley’s Fourth Street;
   </p>
   <p>
    - Thousands of idiosyncratic small bookshops, cafés, bars and other service establishments;
   </p>
   <p>
    - Moments of sudden, unexpected grace - a planted nook, a shaded arcade or courtyard, a humble bench;
   </p>
   <p>
    - London cabs, Amsterdam bikes, old Saigon cyclos, Yamanote-sen trains - and while we’re at it, why not make it safe for motorcyclists so I can ride my beloved SV once more;
   </p>
   <p>
    - All of this undergirded by a thoughtfully-designed informatic infrastructure that sutures all these experiences together, that lets them speak themselves, that does what it needs to and then goes away.
   </p>
   <p>
    How’s that? Schizogeographic enough for you?
