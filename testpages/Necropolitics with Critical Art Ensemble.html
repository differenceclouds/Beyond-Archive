 Necropolitics with Critical Art Ensemble

   Well, since the
  </span>
  blog's "dead," I reckon we can indulge in some "necropolitics." Especially since this is Steve Kurtz speaking.
 </p>
 <p>
  *Also, "nettime" isn't dead, so maybe I should write something for them every once in a while.

  Way back in the day this list was used as a site to get feedback on
  <br/>
  papers due for publication and/or presentation. If I can, I would like
  <br/>
  to somewhat resurrect this function, by asking the collective
  <br/>
  intelligence of this list for some help on a presentation I am trying to
  <br/>
  structure. I need it. Those of you familiar with the work of Critical
  <br/>
  Art Ensemble (CAE) know that for the past few years we have been
  <br/>
  examining the very difficult and underdeveloped topic of necropolitics
  <br/>
  (mostly through an environmental lens). Recently we were asked to
  <br/>
  comment on what necropolitics means in relation to the current uprising
  <br/>
  in the US. We are finding this request to be a tough task.
 </p>
 <div class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx">

 <p>
  As always the biopolitical/biopower answer to the question of the
  <br/>
  uprising is rather easy: In order to make the social environment
  <br/>
  habitable for people of color major structural revisions in the
  <br/>
  institutional justice system must be made, and an uprising will help to
  <br/>
  force and expedite these necessary changes. However wherever biopower
  <br/>
  expresses itself, necropolitics is going to do so as well. They are
  <br/>
  inseparable. The necropolitical is much harder to analyze and discuss,
  <br/>
  because we are not asking who should live and how, but who should die
  <br/>
  and how. We are asking, how do we produce a social environment that is,
  <br/>
  for some, uninhabitable. When there is an uprising part of the
  <br/>
  collateral damage is that innocent people are killed and maimed, and/or
  <br/>
  general misery within impacted areas is increased. How do we speak about
  <br/>
  this human sacrifice given the belief (that CAE certainly holds) that an
  <br/>
  uprising is a tactic that can be called upon to resist oppression, and
  <br/>
  the sacrifice of the innocent in this case is acceptable?
 </p>
 <p>
  Unlike with biopolitics, we believe we cannot make an appeal to justice.
  <br/>
  One cannot argue for the "just" killing of innocent people. This debate
  <br/>
  of just killing of the innocent is centuries old in the guise of can
  <br/>
  there be a just war? CAE tends to fall on the side of "No, there can't
  <br/>
  be a just war." But there can be an acceptable war-from the point of
  <br/>
  view of the defenders, WWII is, even though some of the most horrific
  <br/>
  atrocities of all time were committed by those very same defenders. As
  <br/>
  with uprisings, although on a far greater scale, wars kill and maim
  <br/>
  innocent civilians who want no part of the combat nor deserve any.
  <br/>
  Conservatives, on the other hand, are again promoting the idea of a just
  <br/>
  war. George W. Bush and the Neocons resurrected this concept for the
  <br/>
  Middle East wars. It's fine for the innocent to die if the cause is
  <br/>
  Just; we will mourn their loss. That was combined with the belief that
  <br/>
  those who are on the side of Justice cannot commit murderous crimes
  <br/>
  (perverse American exceptionalism). Certainly, Trump and the evangelical
  <br/>
  mafia with which he surrounds himself believe this about policing.
  <br/>
  Speaking of necropolitics through the lens of Justice is a very fraught
  <br/>
  road to walk down.

 <p>
  Nor do we want to put on our quant hat and use the necropolitical
  <br/>
  language of insurance adjusters-add up the value of lives, and choose
  <br/>
  the lower of the two numbers. Even if such things as the "value of a
  <br/>
  life" could be measured, this form of utilitarian quantitative analysis
  <br/>
  is only wonderful if you are in the greatest good for the greatest
  <br/>
  number set, but not so much if you are in the minority set. The current
  <br/>
  model of policing in the US seems to have been using this model for at
  <br/>
  least 50 years now, and is part of the reason we find ourselves in the
  <br/>
  middle of an uprising in the first place.
 </p>

 <p>
  The medical necropolitical language of triage could be used if done so
  <br/>
  in the peacetime sense. Those with the greatest need get the greatest
  <br/>
  amount of resources. Such a means to set policy on asset distribution
  <br/>
  could solve some problems. However, what happens if the model reverts to
  <br/>
  wartime? The US has done precisely this during the pandemic. Triage then
  <br/>
  means those with simplest maladies to cure, and thereby those who amass
  <br/>
  the greatest amount of future life years get the resources, and those
  <br/>
  who are badly wounded or sick with few life years are abandoned. This
  <br/>
  model would bode especially badly for the elderly during a pandemic, and
  <br/>
  for minorities all the time.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is currently the model for distribution of medical resources in the
  <br/>
  US, and in turn has become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Ultimately, the
  <br/>
  triage model does not explain why innocent deaths are acceptable. It's a
  <br/>
  limited, pragmatic model for organizing death in emergency and
  <br/>
  nonemergency situations.
 </p>
 <p>
  So what makes blood sacrifice of the innocent acceptable (not justified)
  <br/>
  during an uprising? Is it an emergent cultural groupthink? Or is it a
  <br/>
  nonrational individual impulse? A combination thereof? I know that
  <br/>
  after I finish this post I am going drink some alcohol. If I am so
  <br/>
  concerned about human sacrifice and particularly that of the innocent,
  <br/>
  how can I not be supporting the prohibitionists trying to make alcohol
  <br/>
  illegal? After all, it is a substance that is responsible for so much
  <br/>
  premature death, illness and addiction, accidents, and alcohol fueled
  <br/>
  violence of all kinds. Yet I find these casualties perfectly acceptable,
  <br/>
  and want alcohol to be cheap, plentiful, and readily available.
 </p>
 <p>
  To CAE, when it comes to necropolitics reason is insufficient, and
  <br/>
  necropolitics is a part of the nonrational realm, where like most things
  <br/>
  nonrational, it will be ignored by the vast majority . I hope someone
  <br/>
  here can tell us different, because I don't want to believe this. Many
  <br/>
  thanks, Steve
